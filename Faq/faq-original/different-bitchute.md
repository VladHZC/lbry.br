title: How is LBRY different from "decentralized" websites, like BitChute or DTube?
category: differences

There are a number of web-based digital content sites, such as BitChute, DTube, DLive, or many others that claim to be some form of decentralized, censorship-resistant, or peer-to-peer.

There are a number of differences between LBRY and any specific platform, but there are two vital differences common to all of them:

1. They all still have a single, centralized control point, typically their website.
2. They all rely on the assumption that a single entity will continue to act benevolently for all time.

## Why is that worse?

Let’s look at the differences through an example, Bitchute.

For each video, BitChute creates a corresponding torrent, that is supposed to decentralize the hosting of the data (though this is [disputed](https://www.dailydot.com/layer8/bitchute-decentralization-claims/)).

However, let’s assume that there are magically enough people who download and continue to host these torrents, for free. All of the metadata and the entire user-experience is still *entirely* wrapped up in BitChute.

There is no alternative client. There is no data network that users are actively participating in (unless the video is open). If BitChute goes down, closes, or is taken over by censorious scolds (or the rent-extractors), *the whole thing is gone*. No one can even make another copy of it, because the source is closed.

Additionally, a single point of censorship means those around the world who would attempt to ban facts because they find them inconvenient have a clear place to go and ban them.

## How is LBRY better?

In the case of LBRY:

- You can access and use LBRY in a truly decentralized, peer-to-peer way. Via [LBRY Desktop](https://lbry.com/get), anyone in the world can access the LBRY network without relying on LBRY Inc. servers or machinery.
- If LBRY ever turns evil, all code is open-source and anyone in the world (okay, mainly nerds) could develop and release their own version with minimal effort. Hundreds of people have contributed to LBRY, the vast majority as volunteers.
- *Anyone in the world* can run their own version of lbry.tv or make their own LBRY app, completely separate from us and without our permission.

## I'm a creator that wants to make a comparative video between LBRY and another platform.

That's awesome! We're offering 1000 LBC to any creator who wants to make a video on this subject.

Here's how to get it:

1. Make the video. You should show the experience within the applications to make the comparison. Any conclusions you reach are fine (that is, it doesn't have to be pro-LBRY), so long as it doesn't actively misstate anything about LBRY.
1. Post it to LBRY and the platform you are comparing us to. Add the tag #lbryvs (you can also add #lbryvsbitchute, #lbryvsdlive, etc.)
1. Tweet at @LBRYio and the platform you are comparing us to with a link to the video and using the same hashtag(s) mentioned above. If you don't use Twitter, you can email hello@lbry.com with a link to your video and a screenshot of you posting about it somewhere else.

LBRY reserves the right to not offer this reward if you attempt to abuse it (for example, by creating a brand new account and creating an extremely low-effort video).
