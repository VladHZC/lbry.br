YouTube, Netflix, Apple TV, and other similar services are centralized platforms controlled by a single corporation. These companies have the ability to change the rules at will, demonetize content, and even censor content to appease governments or corporate partners or advertisers. These companies offer no transparency into their source code or content search/viewing algorithms. Many creators have found themselves deplatformed and out of business overnight.

In contrast, LBRY is a decentralized, open-source protocol that is controlled by its users. LBRY facilitates a similar experience to the aforementioned services but does it in a way that is entirely decentralized and censorship-resistant. LBRY can never deplatform, demonetize or arbitrarily change the rules on publishers or consumers, making it dramatically more trustworthy.
