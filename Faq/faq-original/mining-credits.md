title: How do I mine LBC?
category: mining

Library Credits (LBC) are mined over a [20-year Proof of Work](/faq/block-rewards) period.
Block rewards increase every 100 blocks by 1LBC, peak at 500, and decline slowly.

LBRY mining is dominated by the GPU and FPGA market, and we don't see CPU mining as economically viable at this point.

For GPU/ASIC mining, please see our list of [pools](/faq/mining-pools). Each pool has a slightly different setup so please check their Getting Started/help page. We can also provide mining assistance via [Discord Chat](https://chat.lbry.com).
**Note:** Sgminer is for AMD GPUs and CCminer is for Nvidia GPUs.
